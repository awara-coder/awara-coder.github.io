To preview the website locally, you can run a simple HTTP server from the root directory of the project.

    ```bash
    cd awara-coder.github.io
    ```

2.  **Start the Python HTTP server:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m http.server
    ```
    If you have Python 2, you might need to use:
    ```bash
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer
    ```

3.  **View the website:**
    Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

The website content is dynamically loaded from the `data.json` file. To update the portfolio with your own information, simply edit that file.
